Minecraft for the web
This project was originally made by lax1dude, and it is called eaglercraft. Eaglercraft is REAL minecraft 1.5.2
PLAYABLE in any modern web browser. But the only catch is that it is FREE and the Mojang Enforcement Team is trying to take it down via DMCA, I am only making this respository so I can get this uploaded to a website so an Icon can be on my Desktop, leading me straight to the webapp.

So basically this a webapp clone of Eaglercraft, that can be run on CHROMEBOOKS...
